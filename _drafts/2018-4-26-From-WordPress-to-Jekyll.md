title: From WordPress to Jekyll
---

Yesterday my hosting provider reminded me that I have to pay 100+ bucks for my blog.  
I'm the one that pays for valuable things, but during last year I realized I don't need all the bloatware of a WordPress blog, so I decided to go to GitHub pages.
GitHub pages it's nice: you can use Git to manage your files, and with tools like MarkDown and Jekyll, edit and publish content is a breeze.  
So I decided to jump: here's my journey.  

# Exporting data from your old WordPress blog
Of course there's a plugin for that!
See: [Jekyll Exporter](https://it.wordpress.org/plugins/jekyll-exporter/). I used this solution, and it worked like a charme.  
You can even do the reverse: export data from WordPress using its format, then importing it into Jekyll; see [How to Convert a Wordpress Site to Jekyll with Github Pages](http://adam.garrett-harris.com/how-to-convert-a-wordpress-site-to-jekyll-with-github-pages/).  
The Internet is plenty of this kind of _from WordPress to Jekyll_ resources, so ask Google if you have more questions :)
