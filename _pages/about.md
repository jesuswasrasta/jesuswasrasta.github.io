**Ferdinando Santacroce** is a developer, author, trainer and speaker who loves learning new things.

As a **software developer**, Ferdinando worked a lot on the <a title="Microsoft Dot Net Platform" href="http://www.microsoft.com/net" target="_blank">.NET platform </a>using <a title="C Sharp" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a>, bridging the gaps from old style systems and new technologies. During his career he has allowed <a title="Microfocus COBOL" href="http://microfocus.com/" target="_blank">COBOL</a> applications to talk with remote services, databases and electronic devices like _cash handlers_, _document scanners_ and _electronic shelf labels_.  
At the moment he focuses on Java and JavaScript projects, working on software for a big Italian energy player.

He pursue continuous improving and the <a title="The Agile Manifesto" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Movement</a>, which he follows with great care, in conjunction with <a title="eXtreme Programming" href="http://xprogramming.com/index.php" target="_blank">eXtreme Programming</a> foundations and <a title="Lean Manufacturing" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing" target="_blank">Lean Manufacturing</a>.
  
Since 2015, he is a member and advisor of [Italian Agile Movement](http://www.agilemovement.it), an associations that takes care of agile disciplines in Italy; every year he contributes to the organization of the [Italian Agile Days](http://www.agileday.it), the biggest conference in Italy about the topic.

As a **teacher**, Ferdinando realized the first web-based school register on his school district, allowing parents to take a look at grades and absences day by day.
  
He loves even teach to ordinary people, from children to grandpas, getting them ready for the use of computers, Internet and new mobile devices.

Ferdinando enjoys writing, too; after some years of silence, he started to blog again about his **work** and **passions**, which often ends to be the same thing.
  
He also wrote a book :orange_book: for [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) about **Git**, [Git Essentials](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text=Ferdinando+Santacroce&search-alias=books&field-author=Ferdinando+Santacroce&sort=relevancerank "Ferdinando Santacroce on Amazon").

Mostly of what he learned comes from his fellows and colleagues, which incites him reading books, attend to inspiring conference like <a title="XP Conf" href="http://xp2015.org" target="_blank">XP Conf</a>, <a title="Agile Day" href="http://www.agileday.it/" target="_blank">Italian Agile Day</a>, <a title="Codemotion" href="http://it.codemotionworld.com/" target="_blank">Codemotion</a>, other that helping his growth working on the same code with him.

All the energy he spend comes from his wife, Maria, and their newborn kid, Giovanni.

# My Writings
I like writing.  

## Git Essentials
Some time ago I wrote a book for [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) about _Git_, **[Git Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/git-essentials)**.

I really enjoyed writing it, I learnt a lot. So I decided to write it again :)  
**[Git Essentials, 2nd Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/git-essentials-second-edition)**.
