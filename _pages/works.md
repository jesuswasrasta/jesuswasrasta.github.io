I like reading, and I like writing, too.  
Here some of the latest things I worked on.  

## Git Essentials
Some time ago I wrote a book for [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/){:target="_blank"} about _Git_.  

[Git Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/git-essentials){:target="_blank"}.

<!-- ![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg){: .full} -->

The book has been included in [Git Survey 2016](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSurvey2016){:target="_blank"}, gaining the 3rd place (light-years behind [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), of course :sweat_smile:).  

I really enjoyed writing it, I learnt a lot. So I decided to write it again :smiley:   

[Git Essentials, 2nd Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/git-essentials-second-edition){:target="_blank"}.

Follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13649672.Ferdinando_Santacroce){:target="_blank"} to learn more about books I like and I write.

## Mokabyte
I'm a Technical Author for [Mokabyte](http://www.mokabyte.it){:target="_blank"}, a 20 years old Italian webzine.  
Here my series about [Git, the stupid content tracker](http://www.mokabyte.it/author/ferdinando-santacroce/){:target="_blank"}.
