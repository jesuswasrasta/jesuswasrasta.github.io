I'm going to getting rid of my browser bookmarks, so this page is born :smile:   
This is a list about OOP, a place where I append interesting things I'm discovering about OOP since 2005...  
Today is a massive, incomplete and unordered mess of links, but this leaves me more room for improvement :grin:  
Anyway, great value is assured :smiley:.
